The Smart Assistance for the Visually Impaired project is designed to enhance the mobility and 
safety of blind individuals through a comprehensive system that integrates both sensor-based 
environmental detection and machine learning for road-crossing assistance. 
The project leverages ultrasonic sensing, weather monitoring, and image recognition to provide real-time 
audio feedback, helping users navigate their surroundings confidently and securely.
The motivation for this project arises from the significant challenges visually impaired individuals 
face in their day-to-day lives, particularly in navigating urban environments that are not always 
optimized for accessibility. 
Traditional solutions, such as white canes or guide dogs, while 
helpful, do not offer a holistic approach to the various obstacles and dangers present in modern 
cities. 
Thus, this project seeks to provide a more comprehensive and intelligent solution by 
incorporating a multi-sensor approach and machine learning for traffic related cues, which are 
crucial for ensuring safe pedestrian movement across busy streets.
